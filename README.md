The intensive non-linear system and plants of modern industry highly motivating researcher to extend and evolve non-linear control systems. In this study, in order to control a class of non-linear uncertain power systems in the presence of large and fast disturbances, a new simple indirect adaptive proportional-integral is proposed.

For handling dynamic uncertainties, the proposed controller utilities the advantages of least squares support vectors regression (LS-SVR) to approximate unknown non-linear actions and noisy data.
